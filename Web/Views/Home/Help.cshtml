				<br /><br /><b><u>Search Tips</u></b><br /><br />
				<ol>
					<li>Make your search as specific as possible.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>If you are searching for a specific phrase, be sure to include quotations around the Phrase. (Ex. rather than searching for <code><b>tomb of David</b></code>, search for the phrase <code><b>"tomb of David"</b></code> to get more relevant results.<br /><br /></li>
					<li>If you do not use quotes around your phrase, the system will remove common words (of, and, the, etc) and then find results that match ALL the remaining words.</li>
				</ol>
